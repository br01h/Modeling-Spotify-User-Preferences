# Modeling Spotify User Behaviour

Welcome to my machine learning demo using my own and an anonymous users' Spotify streaming and library data.

This project uses the Spotify API to extract more data from user streaming history such as genre information and audio features which can potentially be used for understanding user sentiment and tendencies. Given the project is a work in progress, much of the current work entails EDA. Ultimately, though the final goal is to perform advanced predictive modeling on user data so that we can predict and recommend genres a user may like using their past streaming and library data. We can also take advantage of their listening habits to understand how listening patterns may change over time.
